# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

I think that my ability to space out my time went very well this week to the point where I never felt stressed to complete something on-time. I think a noteworthy surprise would maybe be that I didn't have to ask as many questions as I thought I would, but ended up asking more hypothetical questions such as asking how someone else may have accomplished the same task. I would say I'm struggling with remembering names of functions so it can be hard to google what I'm looking for specifically, however I've started to become more acquainted with said functions as time goes on. A victory for sure was completing the website myself (regardless of how horrid it may look from a design standpoint).
