## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
Making sure the user is able to accomplish everything smoothly with a little less jank was a big one.
2. What went well this week?
I think that writing the overall backend and completing the tests went really smoothly.
3. What would you do differently?
Possibly just try to work a little faster because I can get caught up on something and just sit there for a long time thinking about how to solve something when instead I could be asking for help, or even better I could be trying to solve the problem through trial and error.
