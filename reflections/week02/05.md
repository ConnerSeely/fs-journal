# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?
I think that the topics covered in days 1 and 3 went much better than that of the other days. I think the biggest thing I'm struggling with is for in loops and grabbing objects from dictionaries, however I can do arrays just fine with foreach loops. I think a definite victory is accomplishing the main goals of the checkpoint within the day I received it even though I believe I definitely took the easy way out avoiding dictionaries, but I'll still take the W.
