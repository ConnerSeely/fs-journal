## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use
A Pseudo-Class adds a certain style to a selector, but only when it meets certain conditions. Hover and Focus will probably be the most common ones I'd use.
2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
specificity refers to a value that certain lines of code are given so that style or class will happen before another.
3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
If your code becomes over-saturated with the !important feature it can cause problems with the feature trying to override itself which wouldn't work.
