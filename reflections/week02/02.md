## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

function name(parameters){}
let name = function (parameters){}
let name = (parameters) => {}
 there is no difference between the first two, however the arrow function does not create their own this value.
2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
Parameters are the properties of a function and possibly don't have assigned values yet, While arguments are the properties of a particular call to a function.
3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example? A higher order function is a function that accepts other functions as parameters and/or returns a function. I think an example would possibly be a function accepting an array and then returning different values.
