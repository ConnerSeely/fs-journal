## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
It helps tremendously to prevent large mistakes where maybe you need to rearrange everything in one spot because it doesn't look how you thought it would.
2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?
By researching about the topic without looking up the exact solution, that way you can learn and solve the problem yourself.
3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?
That it's important to actually understand the topic that you are writing about, so that if you run into problems you can be prepared to debug and solve them yourself without have to spend a bunch of time looking up how to fix the problem.
