## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 
Wire-framing allows the designer to get feedback when testing early stages of the wire-frame itself.
2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
Low, mid, and high-fidelity wire-frames are all useful in their own ways. Low is more so used for mapping the overall presence of everything on the page through empty columns or rows and so on while medium and high start to get into where everything may be located exactly on the page.
3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
I think it depends on the scope of the project, because in certain large projects wire-framing can become extremely useful for staying organized and on top of what you are designing.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
That it's important to know what you are designing before you commit to a project because it can become excruciatingly hard to create the design as you go as your project gets larger and you realize that not everything may be able to fit in certain spots.
