## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?
columns are the individual variables while rows are the overall object that holds all those variables such as a house.
2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.
CREATE TABLE characters(
  id int NOT NULL,
  name string,
  age int,
  description string
);
3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;

delete removes certain rows while drop removes entire tables.
```
