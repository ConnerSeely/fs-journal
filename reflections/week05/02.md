## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?
1:1, 1:N, and N:M (Many-To-Many)
2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`
The tradition linking of relationships can allow you to grab everything all at once through a foreign id which can allow you to not have to have the information all in one place.
3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?
When N has a maximum of 3 while M has a lot of entries then its better to do one way embedding while if M is a maximum of 5 then two way embedding could be better.
