## Questions

1. What is Scope ?
    Scope refers to the current context of code, meaning that something that is globally scoped exists outside of a function, while something that is function scoped exists within a function.
2. What is Hoisting ?
    Hoisting is a special JS mechanism that basically moves code around for you so that the variable is defined first before called upon.
3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
var is generally globally scoped meaning it can work everywhere but can cause problems when redefining the variable without realizing. Let and const are both block-scoped meaning that let variables can be updated but not re-declared while const cannot do either.
