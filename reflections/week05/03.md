## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?
A time management technique that focuses on completing task within a time you give yourself.
2. What three strategies will you implement and how?
Definitely prioritizing certain timeboxes more than others so that to not waste time where its not needed. Another one is understanding when I work the best and using "golden hour" to my advantage. Lastly I will try to get the hardest timebox out of the way first which can help with timeboxing other things later in the day.
3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 
School assignments would have been a lot easier at times if I didn't focus so hard on one paragraph of an English essay and so on.
