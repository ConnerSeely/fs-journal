## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
Possibly the most unique design tip is reducing the opacity so that the background color seeps through creating less clash between the two colors.
2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.
I think a resource that could be helpful is looking at riot games' website and their design choices and simplicity of their website.
3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
I think that good design influences people to explore more of what the webpage or whatever else has to offer. I think that you can convey a plethora of things through design alone with visual examples sort of like imbedding a trailer for a video game next to a download button.
